    <p>My Coding Plan for Today:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Spend 30 minutes working on stretch features of my project,
        that has not been formally assigned yet.  These are important 
        features that I really really want to put in, but might not 
        actually make it in there due to time constraints.</li>
      <li>Spend 30 minutes evaluating features that will most likely 
        actually make it to the final version of the project.</li>
      <li>Do the other errands that I need to do for my job and my 
        life today.</li>
    </ul>
